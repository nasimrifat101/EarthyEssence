**Note**: This README is part of the initialization process. More information and detailed documentation will be added as the project progresses.

## Project Overview

EarthyEssence is an online nursery website developed using React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Redux, and Vite. The website allows users to browse, filter, and search for products, add products to their cart, and make online payments via Stripe.js. Additionally, there is a product and category management section for CRUD operations.
